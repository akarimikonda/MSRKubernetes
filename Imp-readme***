1.Kubernetes Cluster (1master and 2 workers) setup was built on Google Cloud Centos VMS
2.Tomcat server with sample war file deployement is done. Respective files are Dockerfile | sample.war | msrwebapprcdemo.yaml
3.I didnt get chance to implement load balancer, so i exposed the webapp to Node port. 
4.Mongodb database was setup and exposed via node port only.
5.These can be accessed by outside world via node port
6.Used replica sets

When ever you want test the environment, please schedule a meeting. So I will start the instances and i can also help you
with private key and username - so you can login and test it out.
